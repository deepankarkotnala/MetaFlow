# MetaFlow

A basic illustration of Metaflow - a new open source tool to build and manage real-life data science projects. 

We will plot a few graphs and then will predict the values using ML.

better use can be to train multiple models in parallel and then use the model which provides the best resukts as per the parameters like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, etc.
